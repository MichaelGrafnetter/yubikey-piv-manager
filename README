=== Known issues

==== Deleting certificates
Note that the dialog showed in PIV Manager when deleting a certificate currently states
that the private key is being deleted as well. That is not the case, only the certificate is deleted.
To make sure the private key is destroyed, it is recommended to generate a new private key in the same slot or
